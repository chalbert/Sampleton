Sampleton is a Web App helping in your sampling projects. Its main focus as for now is biological survey but it 
will in time be usable for any type or survey.

## Project

A project is your experiment, your survey. You will define what to count and Sampleton will help 
you streamline the recording process.

A *template* can be associated with a project, providing a way to create a form and to record rich informations 
on each sampling item.

### Item

### Record

for each sample.

### Template

informations for each specimen.
